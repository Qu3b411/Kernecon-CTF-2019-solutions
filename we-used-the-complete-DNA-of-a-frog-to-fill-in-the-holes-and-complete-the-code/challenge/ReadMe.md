# We used the complete DNA of a frog to fill in the holes and complete the code.

**you have been given a binary that contains two functions that you must reverse.**

The first function is DinoDnaSeq(), this function makes a total of 64 calls to differing functions, some of these are to HoleInDna!

the second function is FrogDnaSeq(), this function makes a total of 64 calls to differing functions, none of these will be to HoleInDna!

**For a function call to HoleInDna** you must find the corresponding function call in the FrogDnaSeq and update it accordingly,  
 **[NOTE:** malloc is not counted as one of the 64 calls made **]**
 
 
# Hint: figure out the sudo algorithm and write the solution yourself
**just verify your result:** the algorith and sha256 key to verify that you have the right result is in main!
