# I did a test run on this thing it took me twenty minutes
**you have been provided with an application login**. 
figure out how to get the flag

#P.S

You might Think its a good idea to reverse engineer it to find the solution, let me assure you **Don't Bother**, I have made the binary stupidly large and convoluted with many distinct branches to waist your time if you try. 

valid characters are:
{0-9},{a-f},k,r,n,l,'}','{'

be smart about finding the flag, brute force wont get you very far!
